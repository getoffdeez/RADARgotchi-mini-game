# RADARgotchi-mini-game

This game was made with Game Maker 2. The objective of the game is to shoot as many orbs as you can without letting them hit you. 

* Use the left, up, and right arrow keys to move and dodge the orbs. 
* To shoot the orbs, simply right-click the mouse. Each time you successfully shoot an orb, you earn 1 point.

Be careful not to get hit by the orbs, as they will cause you to lose the game and all your points will be lost.
